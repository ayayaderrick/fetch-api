# Fetch API Tutorial: 10 Steps to Understanding (Async/Await Edition)

This project is a step-by-step tutorial designed to help you understand the fundamentals of the Fetch API in JavaScript. It was initially created by Professor Steve Griffith on GitHub, who primarily used `.then()` chaining for handling promises returned by `fetch`.

As a contributor, I have refactored the original code to utilize the more modern `async/await` syntax for handling asynchronous operations, making the code potentially easier to read and manage.

## Getting Started

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need:

- A web browser with developer tools (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
- A basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Introduction to Fetch API**: Learn the basics of the Fetch API and how it simplifies HTTP requests.
- **Practical Examples**: Explore real-world use cases, including GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.
- **Error Handling**: Understand how to handle errors and manage responses effectively.
- **Working with JSON**: Learn how to fetch and manipulate JSON data.
- **Cross-Origin Requests**: Tips for handling CORS issues.
- **Fetching Multiple Resources:** Learn how to fetch data from multiple API endpoints concurrently using `Promise.all()` with `async/await`.
- **Working with Query Parameters:** Understand how to append query parameters to your API request URLs.
- **Setting Request Headers:** Learn how to customize request headers, such as `Content-Type` and authorization tokens.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fetch-api.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the examples.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and HTML.
- A modern web browser with Fetch API support.
